Here's a "line block":

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

![example image](!1.jpg! "An exemplary image")

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
